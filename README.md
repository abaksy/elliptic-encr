# Encryption based on conic curves

This is a C++ implementation of a basic encryption algorithm that generates an encryption key based on a pseudorandomly parameterized conic curve. 

The inverse function of the same conic curve may then be used to decrypt the encrypted message and return the original message

The file 'file_encryption.cpp' writes the encoded text to a text file which is read by the file 'file_decryption.cpp'
